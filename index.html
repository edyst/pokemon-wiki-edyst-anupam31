            Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
            Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing
            video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers</p>

                <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.</p>

        <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                    Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                    evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
                    generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
                    Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
                <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
            </ul>

            <li style=" font-size: 20px;padding-top: 15px;">What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with,
                    but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
                    Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've
                    reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is
                    a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

            <p style="padding: 20px 0;">
                Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core
                series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type
                matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly
                different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly
                closer in line.

                popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime after, and the Blue version was
                reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original Green version was
